1) terraform init
A hidden directory is created .terraform. It contains provider and plugin
Another file created terraform.lock.hcl to store privider selections made

2) terraform plan -out=planfilename   (The terraform plan -out command in Terraform is used to create an execution plan and save it to a specified file. 
This file can later be used with the terraform apply command to execute the exact changes planned without needing to re-create the plan. )
3) terraform apply planfilename
4) terraform destroy

terraform apply planfilename

terraform plan -out=planfilename -var-file="custom.tfvars"

- If you provide the tfvars file name in terraform plan then no need to mention tfvars file name in terraform apply again
- If you do terraform plan with out and plan file name then you run terraform apply with that file name, 
it will not ask for approval again. 

terraform import <resource-type.resourcename> <resource-id>
